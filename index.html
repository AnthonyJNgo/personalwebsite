            <h2> About me:</h2>
            <p> In the future I'll put a short bio here about myself.</p>

            <h3> Projects:
            </h3>

            <p>
                This is where I'll talk about all of my projects! I'll put a few images of them along with a short description
                and then have it redirect to a page specifically for the project.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h4> Interests:
            </h4>

            <p>I'll leave this section available to talk about my interests, technical and non-technical. These would most likely
                include Python, C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as Shiba Inus, sushi, photography, and nature.</p>

        <div>
            <h5>Notes to self:</h5>
            <p> I think it would be nice to have a little box area to the left of the website with the headshot, and a very
                short bio/summary. The about me can contain a longer bio. It would make it look much neater, I think I've seen
                this design elsewhere. I like the minimalistic style of using whites, light greys, etc. but perhaps in the future
                I can look into incorporating a darkmode theme? Any app/website nowadays in my opinion should give the option of a 
                light theme and dark theme. Center the main title, make the navbar stick to the top and probably enlarge it. Have it
                highlight whichever option is being hovered over. This is a good rough draft. I should include a space theme also,
                that would be really cool.
