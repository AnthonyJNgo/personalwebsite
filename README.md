# personalwebsite
A personal website! Created to showcase projects, skills, and my personal interests.

This is a little project I started after my google home testing. I'll be updating it as time goes by to make it much nicer. I could have used
wordpress or a framework to have something set up out of the box, but I wanted to have complete freedom to make mistakes and accomplishments
as I go along. This is a very simple project, as of now consisting of basic html and css.

This site is currently published via github pages @: https://anthonyjngo.github.io/personalwebsite/
